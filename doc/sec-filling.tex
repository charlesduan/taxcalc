\section{Phase Three: Form Filling}

To fill in the forms, create a script that creates a FormManager object with the
tax forms from phase 1 imported. Then create a MultiFormManager to handle the
filling of forms. For each form to be filled in, use the fill\_form method of
the MultiFormManager.

The MultiFormManager can automatically produce continuation sheets when there is
insufficient space. This requires providing two options:
\begin{description}
\item[continuation\_bio] Biographical text for the continuation sheets, just for
identification purposes.
\item[continuation\_display] Either :show, which will print the continuation
page to the screen; :raw, which will print the raw troff code; or :append, which
will compile the troff code and append the continuation sheet to the filled tax
form.
\end{description}
