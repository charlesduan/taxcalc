\title{Framework for Tax Preparation}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

This is a software system for automating the computation and filling of tax
forms. Much like commercial software for tax preparation, the object of the
system is to allow a user to enter data from received tax forms and other
sources, and then answer interview questions, to produce completed tax forms
ready for filing.

Unlike commercial tax software, however, this system is not intended to
comprehensively cover all tax forms and options. Instead, a second object of
this system is to provide a framework to make it reasonably easy for
programming-adept users to add tax forms as necessary to their personal
situations and needs.

\section{Overview of Operation}

Use of the system proceeds in three phases.

The first phase is the computation of form values. The user enters relevant data
from received tax forms and other sources into files, and then writes a short
script that imports that data and computes the values for tax forms to be
prepared. This produces a plain text file containing the line item data to be
filled into the tax forms.

The second phase is the identification of form fields. For each tax form to be
filled in, the user provides the PDF file for the blank form and also the file
of line item data. A program displays a graphical interface where the user can
click on the blank spaces where each line item should be entered. The result of
this is a second plain text data file that lists the coordinates of each of the
form fields.

The third phase is the actual filling of the forms. The user writes another
short script that receives the data files from the first and second phases, and
places the line items from the first-phase file into the PDF form. If any
changes need to be made subsequently, the user may simply rerun the first-phase
computation script and then rerun the third-phase filling script, thereby
updating all of the tax forms automatically.


\section{Phase One: Computation}

This section describes the operation of the first phase, computation of tax form
line items.

\subsection{Structure of Tax Form Data}

The basic data structure used throughout the system is the TaxForm, which in
essence is simply a named table mapping line numbers to values.





\section{Phase Two: Form Field Marking}

The program that operates this phase is ``mark\_fields.rb''. It must be supplied
with the tax form data produced in phase 1, using the ``-i'' argument. With no
further arguments, the program lists the forms for which the fields have not
been marked yet.

To mark fields in a form, enter the form name as the first non-option argument
to the command. If the form has not been marked yet, you must provide the name
of the PDF file for the form as a second command line argument.

The program will automatically save the location of the PDF file and the
coordinates of the marked fields to a file, which by default is named
``pos-data.txt''. This file name may be changed using the ``-p'' argument.



\section{Phase Three: Form Filling}

To fill in the forms, create a script that creates a FormManager object with the
tax forms from phase 1 imported. Then create a MultiFormManager to handle the
filling of forms. For each form to be filled in, use the fill\_form method of
the MultiFormManager.

The MultiFormManager can automatically produce continuation sheets when there is
insufficient space. This requires providing two options:
\begin{description}
\item[continuation\_bio] Biographical text for the continuation sheets, just for
identification purposes.
\item[continuation\_display] Either :show, which will print the continuation
page to the screen; :raw, which will print the raw troff code; or :append, which
will compile the troff code and append the continuation sheet to the filled tax
form.
\end{description}

\section{Additions to Forms}

\subsection{1098}

\begin{description}
\item[property] The name of the Real Estate form with which this 1098
corresponds.
\item[balance] The average mortgage balance on this loan. See Pub.\ 936.
You can compute this by averaging the balances on January 1 and December 31, or
you can multiply the interest paid by the lowest interest rate of the year.
\end{description}

\item[listed?] Whether the asset is a listed asset, see Pub.~946 chapter 5.
\item[dc\_category] The depreciation category for the asset in DC, see the FP-31
instructions, under Depreciation Guidelines.
