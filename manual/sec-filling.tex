\section{Phase Three: Form Filling}

To fill in the forms, run the script \texttt{ui/fill.rb}. Options for the script
are provided in the help text.

(Filling the forms used to be much more of an ordeal.)

If you get an error about troff missing the \texttt{om} macros, that is because
the ``mom'' macros are missing. The package should be included by default with
the \texttt{groff} package.
